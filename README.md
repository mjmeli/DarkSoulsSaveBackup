Dark Souls Automatic Save Backup
=============

##### Description

NOTE: This repo is not the latest version of this software! I'll try to update this as soon as possible.

This is the source code for my Dark Souls Automatic Save Backup program. This is written in C# targeting .NET 4.5.

I created this program primarily for myself. I have been using other programs, but have wanted a program with a GUI interface that has a few more elaborate features than simply copying files from one directory to another. As such, I made this.

##### Key Features
Compared to other Dark Souls save backup programs, this has all of the standard plus a few unique features:

* **Works with all Dark Souls games**
* GUI!
* Automatic save directory detection
* Customizable backup frequency (in minutes)
* Backup file size tracking
* Easy way to manually clear out all existing backups
* Optional automatic cleanup of old backups (in terms of number of backups kept - option to keep under a file size coming soon)
* Support for multiple save files
* Instant backup option when you need a quick backup
* Instant restore option, which will replace your saves with your most recent backups

##### Bugs/Comments
If you come across any bugs (and there should be plenty!) or have comments, especially feature suggestions, feel free to contact me. I managed to implement everything that I needed to the level I wanted, but I am more than willing to extend what I have for other people.
